            Fashion is part of the daily air, and it does not quite help that it
            changes all the time. Clothes have always been a marker of the era,
            and we are in a revolution. Your fashion makes you seen and heard
            the way you are. So, celebrate the season's new and exciting fashion
            in your own way.
